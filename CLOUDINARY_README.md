## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Add Your Cloudinary Credentials

Edit your `.env.local` file and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Cloudinary credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=acetrack_events_preset
```

### 2. Create Upload Preset

Go to your Cloudinary dashboard and create an upload preset named `acetrack_events_preset`:
- Set it to "Unsigned"
- Set folder to "acetrack/events"
- Configure size and format limits

### 3. Test the Integration

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to your event form and try uploading an image!
