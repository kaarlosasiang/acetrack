- Streamlined role system with 5 predefined roles
- QR code-based attendance with both static and dynamic options

### üîê **Enhanced Security**
- Rate limiting for QR code scanning
- Comprehensive scan attempt logging
- Secure password reset with hashed tokens
- JWT-based dynamic QR codes with 60-second expiry

### üë• **User Management**
- Student self-registration with admin approval workflow
- Simplified user types: `student` and `staff`
- Course and year level tracking for students
- Automatic QR code generation for each student
