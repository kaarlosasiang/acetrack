# Organization Dashboard Test Page

## 🎯 **Simple Organization Dashboard - Ready for Testing**

I've successfully built a comprehensive yet simple organization dashboard page that will test our enhanced authentication system and display user/organization information.

---

## 🚀 **What the Dashboard Does**

### ✅ **Authentication Integration**

- Uses the `useAuth()` context to get user data
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Displays login prompt if user is not authenticated
- Automatically receives user data with organizations from enhanced login

### ✅ **User Information Display**

- **Personal Info**: Name, email, status, course, year level
- **Organization Count**: Shows how many organizations user belongs to
- **Super Admin Badge**: Displays crown icon if user is super admin

### ✅ **Organization Management**

- **Primary Organization**: Shows the main organization (first admin role or first org)
- **Role Display**: Admin (crown), Sub-admin (shield), Member (users icon)
- **Status Badges**: Active (default), Inactive/Invited (secondary)
- **Membership Details**: Role, status, join date

### ✅ **All Organizations List**

- Shows every organization the user belongs to
- Displays role and membership status for each
- Hover effects and proper spacing
- Join date information

### ✅ **Quick Actions**

- Placeholder buttons for:
  - Manage Members
  - Events
  - Analytics
  - Notifications

### ✅ **Debug Information** (Development Only)

- Shows raw user data structure
- Displays organizations array
- Helpful for testing the backend response

## 🔧 **Testing the Dashboard**

### **To Test:**

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - If not logged in: Shows login prompt
   - If logged in: Shows user info and organizations
   - Super admin users: Shows "Super Admin" badge
   - Organization admins: Shows admin role with crown icon
   - Members: Shows member role with users icon

## 🎯 **What This Tests**

### ✅ **Backend Integration**

- Enhanced login response with dashboard_type and dashboard_url

## 🔍 **Debug Features**

In development mode, the dashboard shows:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "email": "user@example.com",
